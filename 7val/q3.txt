Background:
The Maximum Subarray Problem involves finding the contiguous subarray within an array of numbers which has the largest sum. This variant introduces an additional twist by allowing up to k elements in the array to be replaced with zeros, aiming to maximize the sum of a contiguous subarray.

Objective:
Your task is to determine the maximum possible sum of any contiguous subarray within the given array, nums, after replacing up to k elements.

Input:

An array of integers, nums.
An integer, k, representing the maximum number of elements that can be replaced.
Output:

The maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the modified array.
Detailed Explanation with Examples
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1, -2, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], k = 2
Output: 11

Step-by-Step Process:

Starting with the original array, identify the negative elements that, when replaced, would have the most significant impact on increasing the sum of any contiguous subarray.
Replace up to k = 2 negative elements with zeroes (assuming zeroes for simplicity) to avoid decreasing the sum. In this case, strategically replacing the first two negative elements or any two that maximize the contiguous sum is optimal.
The maximum sum achievable from any contiguous subarray after replacements is 11, which comes from the subarray [4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4] after replacements.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2, 3, -4, -1, 4, -2, 2, -1, 3], k = 2
Output: 14

Step-by-Step Process:

Evaluate the array to decide which negative elements to replace to maximize the contiguous subarray sum. Considering the impact of replacements is crucial.
After replacing up to k = 2 negatives, the highest sum of any contiguous subarray is 14, achievable by optimizing the placements of replacements.
Constraints:
The length of the array nums is between 1 and 10^5.
Each element in nums is an integer that lies between -10^4 and 10^4.
The integer k is between 0 and the length of the array nums.
The integer n  is the length of the array.
